In the project file: turn on the MULTIAPP option:

    -MULTIAPP+ 

Splash screen
If the application compiled as a multi-app executable has a 
splash screen and you need to suppress it, 
e.g. when running the executable with a main class 
other than the default, specify the 

-Xnosplash 


option in the Properties-and-options section of 
the command line.

You may also wish to replace the pre-configured splash 
screen image with another one. To do that, use the 
-splash option specifying the pathname of the 
desired image, for example

MyApp -splash:another-splash.gif com.mycompany.app.Main
